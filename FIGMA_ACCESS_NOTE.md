# Important: Figma Design Access

## Current Status

The Figma MCP server is currently unable to access the design file. This requires:
- Paid Figma seat with Dev Mode access
- Proper permissions for the file
- Valid file link

## Next Steps

Once Figma access is restored, the design should be fetched to ensure:

1. **Exact Layout Matching**: Verify spacing, padding, margins match Figma exactly
2. **Typography**: Confirm font sizes, weights, and line heights
3. **Colors**: Verify all color values match the design system
4. **Component Structure**: Ensure all sections match the design hierarchy
5. **Interactions**: Match hover states, transitions, and animations
6. **Responsive Breakpoints**: Verify mobile/tablet layouts match design

## Current Implementation

The website has been built based on the provided requirements:
- All sections are implemented (Navigation, Hero, Portfolio, Services, Why Choose Us, Testimonials, Pricing, CTA, FAQ, Footer)
- Brand colors configured (#00B1D5 for buttons, #90E0EF for accents)
- Responsive design implemented
- All assets (images, icons) are in place
- Component structure is modular and ready for design adjustments

## To Complete Pixel-Perfect Match

1. Enable Figma Dev Mode access
2. Fetch design using MCP server
3. Adjust components to match exact specifications from Figma
4. Verify all visual elements (gradients, shadows, effects) match design
